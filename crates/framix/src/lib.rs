//! Framix is a crate for procedurally generating buildings.
//!
//! The primary API is composed of the [`Module`] trait and the [`Primitive`]
//! trait.
//!
//! The [`Module`] trait is intended to be implemented by users on marker types.
//! The marker types can then be laid out by a user's algorithm to form a
//! building. The trait has a [`render`] method, which returns a
//! [`RenderedModule`] that can be used to spawn the building chunk
//! into the game world.
//!
//! The [`Primitive`] trait defines primitives that can be used to construct
//! modules. The trait has a number of methods that define the properties of the
//! primitive, such as its [`Shape`](bevy_implicits::prelude::Shape),
//! [`Collider`](bevy_xpbd_3d::components::Collider),
//! [`ToonMaterial`](common::materials::ToonMaterial), etc.
//!
//! Essentially, implement [`Primitive`] on the physical building blocks of your
//! building (such as wood planks, shingles, etc.), and implement [`Module`] on
//! the semantic building blocks of your building, (such as a brick wall or
//! roof). The [`Module`] types configure and arrange primitives which can then
//! be spawned into the world.

/// under-reach should be semetrical, similar to the interlocking bricks in a
